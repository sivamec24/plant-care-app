                "description": "Root rot often goes unnoticed until it's advanced because the damage happens underground. Watch for these above-ground warning signs: wilting despite wet soil, yellowing leaves (especially lower ones), mushy brown stems near the soil line, a musty or sour smell from the pot, and slow or stopped growth. Multiple symptoms together strongly suggest root rot.",
                "fix": "If you notice 2 or more of these signs simultaneously, act immediately — don't wait to see if the plant recovers on its own. Early intervention dramatically improves survival chances."

                "description": "Gently remove the plant from its pot and rinse the roots under lukewarm running water to remove all old soil. This gives you a clear view of root health. Healthy roots are white or light tan, firm to the touch, and have a fresh earthy smell. Rotting roots are brown, black, or gray, feel mushy or slimy, and may have a foul odor.",
                "fix": "Be gentle when handling the root ball — damaged but salvageable roots can break easily. If the soil smells strongly of rot, that's confirmation. Place the plant on newspaper or a towel to examine roots."

                "description": "Using clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears sterilized with rubbing alcohol, cut away ALL brown, mushy, or slimy roots. Cut back to where you see healthy white tissue. Don't be conservative — it's far better to have a small amount of healthy root system than a large amount of rotting one. Rotting roots will spread the fungal infection to healthy tissue.",
                "fix": "Sterilize your cutting tool between cuts (dip in rubbing alcohol) to avoid spreading fungal spores. If more than 75% of roots are gone, the plant will need extra care during recovery."

                "description": "After trimming, soak the remaining healthy roots in a solution of one part 3% hydrogen peroxide to two parts water for 10–15 minutes. The bubbling action kills remaining fungal spores on root surfaces without harming the plant. This is a critical step — skipping it risks the fungus re-establishing.",
                "fix": "Alternatively, dust the trimmed roots with a powdered fungicide (like cinnamon powder as a mild natural option, or a commercial root fungicide for severe cases). Let roots air-dry for 30 minutes before repotting."

If reusing the pot, scrub it thoroughly with a solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water, then rinse well and let it dry completely. For severe cases, using a brand new pot is safer. Always choose a pot with drainage holes.",
                "fix": "Consider downsizing the pot slightly — a plant with fewer roots doesn't need as much soil volume. Excess soil around a small root system stays wet too long and invites re-infection."

                "fix": "For the first 2 weeks, water about half as much as you normally would. Place the plant in bright indirect light (not direct sun) to reduce stress. Resist the urge to fertilize — stressed roots can't handle it."

Signs of successful recovery include new leaf growth, firming up of remaining leaves, and the plant regaining its upright posture. Some leaf loss during recovery is normal — the plant is shedding what its reduced root system can't support.",
                "fix": "Check the plant every few days. If wilting continues after 2 weeks despite correct watering, unpot and reinspect — the rot may not have been fully removed. Be patient and avoid overcompensating with water."
